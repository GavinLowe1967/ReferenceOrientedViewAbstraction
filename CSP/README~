Lock-based stack
================

Not using three-way synchronisations:

lockBasedStack0.csp: correct version of the lock-based stack, not using
three-way synchronisations.  286 abstractions.

lockBasedStack0Err1.csp: version where pop does not obtain lock.  Finds error. 

lockBasedStack0Err2.csp: version where push does not obtain lock.  Finds error.

With three-way synchronisations:

lockBasedStack.csp: correct version with three-way synchronisation.  209
abstractions.

lockBasedStackErr1.csp:  version where pop does not obtain lock.  Finds error.

lockBasedStackErr2.csp:  version where push does not obtain lock.  Finds error.

lockBasedStackKeep.csp: version that gives an error, I think because of too
few synchronisations with the watchdog.

Lock-based queue
================

lockBasedQueue.csp: at present finds only four states.  I think the initial
synchronisation between the constructor and the header node is blocked.

Test files
==========

test-file.csp: file used for the unit tests.  125 states
